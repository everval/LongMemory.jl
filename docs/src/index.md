# Long Memory

Documentation for [LongMemory.jl](https://github.com/everval/LongMemory.jl).

## Description

**LongMemory.jl** is a package for time series long memory modelling in ***[Julia](https://julialang.org/)***.

The package provides functions for *generating long memory*, *estimating the parameters of the models*, and *forecasting*.

Generating methods include *fractional differencing*, *stochastic error duration*, and *cross-sectional aggregation*.

Estimators include *classic* ones used to estimate the Hurst effect, those inspired by the *log-periodogram regression*, and *parametric* ones.

Forecasting is provided for all parametric estimators.

Moreover, the package adds *plotting capabilities* to illustrate long memory dynamics and forecasting.

Finally, the package includes the *Nile River minima* and *Northern Hemisphere Temperature Anomalies* data sets to illustrate the use of the functions. 

## Installation

The package is registered in the Julia registry and can be installed at the REPL with `] add LongMemory`.

## Generation

[Long Memory Generation](@ref) contains the documentation for the functions to generate time series long memory models.

## Classic Estimation

[Classic Estimator for the Hurst Effect](@ref) contains the documentation for the functions to estimate the rescaled range (R/S) statistic and the Hurst coefficient.

## Semiparametric Estimators

[Semiparametric Estimators for Long Memory](@ref) contains the documentation for the functions to estimate the long memory parameter based on the log-periodogram regression. Estimators include the Geweke and Porter-Hudak estimators and the Whittle estimator, as well as bias-reduced versions of them.

## Parametric Estimation

[Parametric Estimators for Long Memory](@ref) contains the documentation for the functions to estimate time series long memory models by parametric methods. Of particular interest is the ARFIMA model. Moreover, a method to estimate the HAR model, a specification usually used as a proxy for long memory dynamics, is also available.

## Forecasting

[Forecasting Long Memory Processes](@ref) contains the documentation for the functions to forecast long memory processes using the fractional differencing operator and the cross-sectional aggregation method. Forecasting using the HAR model is also available.

## Data

[Data Available](@ref) contains the list of data sets available in the package.

## Examples

You can follow [this vignette](https://everval.github.io/files/LM_notebook_illustration.html) to learn how to use the package.

## List of Functions

[Index](@ref) contains the list of all the functions in the package.
